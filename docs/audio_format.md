# Audio File Formatting Guide

This document describes the required audio data format and directory structure expected by the **ICI Detector** application.  
The tool is designed to work with continuous or duty-cycle hydrophone recordings prepared according to the **SeisComP Data Structure (SDS)** and stored in **MiniSEED** format.

---

## üìÇ File Format Requirements

- **Format**: MiniSEED (`.mseed`)
- **Sampling rate**: 250 Hz (recommended)  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep the sampling rate below 300 Hz to avoid large files and improve processing speed.
- **Channels**: Single channel per file (1 component only)
- **Duration**: 1 full day per file  
  üëâ Recommended: include a 3-minute overlap with the previous and next day to avoid loss of samples.
- **Duty cycle recordings**: when acquisition is performed in duty cycle mode, create one **Trace per acquisition cycle** within the day.

## üìÅ Directory Structure (SDS Standard)

Files must be stored following the **SeisComP Data Structure (SDS):**

```
<SDSROOT>/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <YEAR>/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <NET>/<STA>/<CHAN>.D/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <NET>.<STA>.<LOC>.<CHAN>.D.<YEAR>.<DOY>
```

**Where:**
- `<SDSROOT>`: root folder of your audio archive
- `<YEAR>`: four-digit year (e.g., `2024`)
- `<NET>`: network code (2 characters, e.g., `XX`)
- `<STA>`: station identifier (e.g., `KERG`)
- `<LOC>`: location code (`00` or left empty)
- `<CHAN>`: channel code (e.g., `HHZ`, `BP1`, etc.)
- `<DOY>`: day-of-year (`001` to `366`)

**Example:**

```
data/2024/XX/KERG/HHZ.D/XX.KERG.00.HHZ.D.2024.073
```

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

Before using the files in the application, make sure:

- [ ] Files are in `.mseed` format (filename without extension)  
- [ ] Sampling rate is **under 300 Hz**  
- [ ] Each file corresponds to a day  
- [ ] File names and paths follow the SDS format  
- [ ] Files are organized into SDS-compliant folders  
- [ ] (Recommended) Files include a 3-minute overlap with previous/next day  

‚ö†Ô∏è Incorrectly formatted files will be skipped or cause errors during analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools for Conversion & Validation

### With ObsPy (Python)

```python
from obspy import read, UTCDateTime

st = read("input.wav")
st = st.resample(250)

# Split and export per 24h segment
start_time = UTCDateTime("2024-03-13T00:00:00")
for i in range(1):
    day_stream = st.slice(start_time + i*86400, start_time + (i+1)*86400)
    day_stream.write("XX.KERG.00.HHZ.D.2024.073", format="MSEED")
```

### With FFmpeg (for WAV conversion)

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.wav -ac 1 -ar 250 -sample_fmt s16 output.wav
```
